# Data Storage and Retrieval 
The programm supposes a shortage in memory capacity and big sized file is required to be sorted to be easely searched.

#####  In this programm multiple algorithms are used In this programm multiple algorithms are used:-
- K-way merge sort with a different runs sizes.
- binary search over sorted binary index file

the programm has function to :-
------------
1. devide the index file into X runs each of Y records.

2.perform internal osrting over each run.

3.perform k way merge srort over X runs  , [ If X != Y multi level merge is performed ].

4.peform binary search over the index file
